        <h1>Pyramids of Giza</h1>
        <p>
          The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb
          of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC
          during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the
          Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely
          intact. As part of the Giza pyramid complex, it borders present-day
          Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481
          feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the
          world for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white
          limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to
          the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). What is seen today is the
          underlying core structure.

        <h1>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h1>
        <p>
          The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the
          Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a
          remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered
          gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines,
          resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was
          said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near
          present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. According to one legend,
          the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The
          Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II, for
          his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and
          valleys of her homeland.

        <h1>Temple of Artemis</h1>
        <p>
          The Temple of Artemis or Artemision, also known as the Temple of
          Diana, was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the
          goddess Artemis (identified with Diana, a Roman goddess). It was
          located in Ephesus (near the modern town of Sel√ßuk in present-day
          Turkey). By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed. Only foundations
          and fragments of the last temple remain at the site. The earliest
          version of the temple antedated the Ionic immigration by many years.
          Callimachus, in his Hymn to Artemis, attributed it to the Amazons.

        <h1>Statue of Zeus</h1>
        <p>
          The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was a giant seated figure, about 12.4 m
          (41 ft) tall, made by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 435 BC at the
          sanctuary of Olympia, Greece, and erected in the Temple of Zeus there.
          Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules
          as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. The statue was a
          chryselephantine sculpture of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden
          framework. Zeus sat on a painted cedarwood throne ornamented with
          ebony, ivory, gold, and precious stones. It was one of the Seven
          Wonders of the Ancient World. The statue was lost and destroyed during
          the 5th century AD.

        <h1>Musoleum at Halicarnassus</h1>
        <p>
          The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus was a tomb built
          between 353 and 350 BC in Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for
          Mausolus, a native Anatolian from Caria and a satrap in the Achaemenid
          Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was
          designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. The
          Mausoleum was approximately 45 m (148 ft) in height, and the four
          sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs, each created by one of
          four Greek sculptors: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros, and
          Timotheus. It was destroyed by successive earthquakes from the 12th to
          the 15th century.

        <h1>Colossus of Rhodes</h1>
        <p>
          The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios,
          erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name,
          by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
          World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of
          Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who had
          besieged it for a year with a large army and navy. According to most
          contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits,
          or 33 metres (108 feet) high - making it the tallest statue in the
          ancient world. It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although
          parts of it were preserved. In accordance with a certain oracle, the
          Rhodians did not build it again.

          The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of
          Alexandria, was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Ancient
          Egypt, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (280-247 BC). It
          has been estimated to have been at least 100 metres (330 ft) in
          overall height. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for
          many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the
          world. The lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes
          between 956 and 1323 AD and became an abandoned ruin. It was the
          third-longest surviving ancient wonder, surviving in part until 1480,
          when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of
          Qaitbay on the site.

          The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of
          Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
          amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
          amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. It could hold an
          estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its
          history, having an average audience of some 65,000. It was used for
          gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts,
          executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman
          mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be
          used for entertainment in the early medieval era.

        <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
        <p>
          Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern
          Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain
          ridge. Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was
          constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438-1472).
          Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most
          familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around
          1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish
          conquest. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple
          of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying
          buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better
          idea of how they originally appeared.

        <p>
          The Taj Mahal, is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right
          bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was
          commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658)
          to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses
          the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
          17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
          house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
          crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially
          completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project
          for another 10 years.

        <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
        <p>
          The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built
          across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and
          Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
          Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
          century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang
          (220-206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall
          remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
          multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the
          wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).

          through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early
          portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900-1200). Chichen Itza was
          one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of
          the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later
          Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse

          forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead
          Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited
          from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in
          what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the
          4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of
          Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time
          Petra had become their capital.

          Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de
          Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built
          by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with
          French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida
          fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is
          30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The
          arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete
          and soapstone. The Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its
          original design. The initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in
          one hand and a cross in the other.
